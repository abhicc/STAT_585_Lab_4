This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **MD** toolbar button for help on Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

This was all until a Katniss Everdeen type character arose from the gutters of Plyr city. Since there were over \Sexpr{sample(1000:10000,1)} people in her family and they were very poor she needed to get a job. However, she had terrifically high self-esteem and thought that she could do more with her life than hang out around the block so she began to learn how to perform rap music. Her hip-hop songs were so good that giggly graduate students would all hunch together and click away on her web videos.
